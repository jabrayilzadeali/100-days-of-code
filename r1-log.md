Active States is harder than I thought in this challenge

**Today's Progress**: I builted mobile versions active state but it doesn't look properly I have the padding issue where paren't padding doesn't let it look properly
**Thoughts:** I believe I have few options one of them use css position get it working or control the padding from that person section.
